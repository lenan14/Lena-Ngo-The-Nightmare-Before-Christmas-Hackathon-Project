    <h1>The Mischievous Gingerbread Man</h1>
    <p id = "story">It was the night before Christmas, and you were ready to fall asleep, but a loud thud jolted you awake. Warily, you go downstairs to see that your gingerbread man statue had disappered! There was an odd trail of what seemed to be crumbs, which you followed, and all of a sudden, you found yourself in a world full of Christmas spirit! You were told to find the missing gingerbread man, or else you'd miss your favorite holiday!</p>
